# SatunolTechnicalTest
The purpose of this app is to complete the technical test given by PT Satunol Mikro Sistem for the position of Android Application Developer. My name is Hisyam Fariqi and I chose number 3 from the task list.

In this app I use the MPAndroidChart dependency to show the Line Chart Diagram as instructed in the task explanation. 
I use blood pressure dataset that I got from kaggle.com and used 3 columns from the dataset. The columns are: id for the patient id, api_hi for systole, and api_lo for diastole.
The dataset is in CSV format and I use opencsv dependency to read the csv file. So the X axis indicates the patient ID, and the Y axis indicates the systole that is in blue color and diastole that is in red color.

The user is able to zoom in/out the chart and tap on one of the point to show the details of the point. To see the result, press the button below and then press the icon at top right twice.
Thank you.
